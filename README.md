# Contract address on Sepolia

0xC6504b39865Fb3eCB55AD3aB89CAbb5293086BDc

# Link to the collection on OpenSea

https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/boatxyz

# Languages and Tools used

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Etherscan

# Hardhat Project commands

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
